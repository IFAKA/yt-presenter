      "recap": "One sentence summary of this section.",

  ],
  "takeaways": [
    "Key takeaway 1",
    "Key takeaway 2",

  ]
}

Rules for "text":
- Remove ALL filler words: um, uh, like (as filler), you know, basically, sort of, kind of, I mean, right?, so basically
- Remove false starts, repetitions, and verbal tics
- Restructure rambling sentences into clear, concise prose
- Each thought should be 1-3 sentences, a complete idea
- Preserve the speaker's meaning and personality, just make it crisp
- Never add information that wasn't in the original

Rules for "emphasis":
- 1-3 words per thought that carry the most semantic weight
- These will be visually highlighted

Rules for "mode":
- "flow" — default, for prose and explanations
- "impact" — for dramatic moments, key insights, short punchy statements (3-8 words)
- "stack" — for lists, enumerations, step-by-step content

Rules for "energy":
- "calm_intro" — opening, setting context
- "explanation" — teaching, explaining concepts
- "building_tension" — leading up to a key point
- "climax" — the key insight or dramatic moment
- "enumeration" — listing items
- "contrast" — comparing/contrasting ideas
- "emotional" — personal stories, feelings
- "question" — rhetorical or real questions
- "resolution" — wrapping up, concluding

Rules for "complexity":
- 0.0-1.0 score
- Higher for technical jargon, dense ideas, multi-clause sentences
- Lower for simple statements, transitions

Rules for narrative arc:
- Energy states should follow natural arcs: calm_intro at openings, building_tension before climax, resolution at section ends
- Limit climax to ~10% of thoughts — overuse dilutes impact
- Every climax should be preceded by at least one building_tension thought

Rules for mode-energy alignment:
- impact mode pairs with climax or building_tension (short punchy statements only)
- stack mode pairs with enumeration
- Never use impact for explanation or calm_intro — those need room to breathe in flow mode

Rules for emphasis specificity:
- Choose words with unique semantic weight — proper nouns, numbers, technical terms, emotionally charged words
- Never emphasize articles, prepositions, or common verbs (the, a, is, was, have, do, get, make)
- 1-3 emphasis words per thought maximum

Rules for mathematical content:
- When the transcript contains spoken math (e.g. "x squared plus 2x equals zero"), convert it to LaTeX notation wrapped in dollar signs: $x^2 + 2x = 0$
- Use single $ for inline math within sentences
- Use double $$ for standalone equations that deserve their own line
- Common patterns: "x squared" → $x^2$, "square root of x" → $\\sqrt{x}$, "integral from a to b" → $\\int_a^b$, "f of x" → $f(x)$, "sum from i equals 1 to n" → $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}$
- Preserve the surrounding prose — only the math notation itself goes inside dollar signs
- If unsure whether something is math, leave it as prose

Rules for "recap":
- One sentence summarizing the section's key point
- Shown at section breaks as a comprehension checkpoint

Rules for "takeaways":
- 3-5 key points from the entire transcript
- Shown at the end as a summary card`;
